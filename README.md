Sail model of CHERI-MIPS ISA
============================

This repository contains a model of the CHERI-MIPS ISA in the [Sail
language](https://github.com/rems-project/sail). Sail can build an ISA
simulator, convert to theorem prover input or generate latex for
inclusion in the CHERI ISA manual.

Sail via OPAM
=============

We recommend to install the Sail compiler using the opam package. See
the following [wiki page](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/wiki/OPAMInstall).

Building
========

The following emulator targets are available:

| Subdirectory | Target | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| mips         | mips   | MIPS emulator built from sail-generated OCaml |
| mips         | mips_c | MIPS emualtor built from sail-generated C |
| cheri         | cheri   | CHERI-MIPS-256 emulator built from sail-generated OCaml |
| cheri         | cheri_c | CHERI-MIPS-256 emualtor built from sail-generated C |
| cheri         | cheri128   | CHERI-MIPS-128 emulator built from sail-generated OCaml |
| cheri         | cheri128_c | CHERI-MIPS-128 emualtor built from sail-generated C |

The C emulator is faster and therefore generally preferable but the OCaml one may be useful for debugging (e.g. any discrepancy in output indicates a bug in Sail or its external function libraries).

The default make target in the top-level directory will build all of the above.

Funding
=======

This software was developed within the Rigorous Engineering of
Mainstream Systems (REMS) project, partly funded by EPSRC grant
EP/K008528/1, at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh.

This project has received funding from the European Research Council
(ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme (grant agreement No 789108, ELVER).

This software was developed by SRI International and the University of
Cambridge Computer Laboratory (Department of Computer Science and
Technology) under DARPA/AFRL contract FA8650-18-C-7809 ("CIFV").
