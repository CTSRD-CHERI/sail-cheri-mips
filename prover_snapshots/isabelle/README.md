# Snapshot of Isabelle definitions of CHERI-MIPS

This directory contains snapshots of the Isabelle theories generated by Sail
for CHERI-MIPS, both for 256-bit capabilities (in the [cheri](cheri/)
subdirectory and the "Sail-CHERI-MIPS" session) and compressed 128-bit
capabilities (in the [cheri128](cheri128/) subdirectory and the
"Sail-CHERI-MIPS-128" session).  This snapshots is provided for convenience,
and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date.

It requires [Isabelle 2020](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2020/index.html)
to build.

A heap image containing the architecture definitions (as well as the Lem and
Sail libraries in the [lib](lib/) subdirectory) can be built using

```
isabelle build -b -D .
```

This takes roughly 20 minutes on an Intel W-2145 CPU at 3.70GHz.

An interactive session based on this heap image can be started using the
following command (replacing `$DIR` with the path of this directory):

```
isabelle jedit -d $DIR -l Sail-CHERI-MIPS
```

See the [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail),
[Lem](https://github.com/rems-project/lem), and
[Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) websites for more information on those
projects.
